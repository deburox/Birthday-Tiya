      <p>Happy Birthday my gullu 🥹
        You’re finally turning 19 — and I can’t tell you how lucky I feel to be a part of this special day in your life.
        
        This photo of yours… I find it sho sho sho cute, I genuinely don’t have words for how it melts my heart every time I look at it! 🥺✨
        
        I swear, I’m way more excited for your birthday than you are! Like a kid waiting outside a cake shop! 😭💗
        
        Thank you for being the light in my life, and for giving me the chance to celebrate you.
        
        Here’s to your 19th, and to many more birthdays we’ll share — together, hand in hand. 🎂🌙
        
        I love you, Tiya. Happy 19th, my moonlight. 🌸💞</p>

      <p>This photo... UGHHH 😫
        I swear I fell in love all over again when you showed me this!
        
        It’s just so innocent, so lovely, so cute, and honestly—what not! 😭💘
        
        And I have to say… the way you placed that gun? Absolute chef’s kiss 🤌
        That’s some commendable planning, madam.
        
        I always knew you had a brilliant mind — but I didn’t know ki bachpan se hi itna dimaag chal raha hai babyji ka 😭💥
        
        My mastermind, my cutie, my Gullu. 💞</p>

      <p>You smiled... and I knew — I had found my person.

        I love you, Baby — and I truly can’t thank you enough for giving me this chance.
        I can’t thank God enough for giving me YOU!
        
        I mean… just look at you!!
        In this photo, you look so pyaari, so magical — Touchwood 🧿
        
        Hamesha aisi hi pyaari rehna…
        Aur hamesha mujhse pyaar karti rehna, Tiya. 🤍
        
        Through every chaos, your presence is my calm.
        Happy Birthday, my love. 🎂✨</p>
