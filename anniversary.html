      <p>Remember this day?
        It was the start of forever. 💫
        
        We really are way too photogenic, don’t you think? 😄
        
        I never thought I’d be able to love someone the way I love you, Tiya.
        And yet, here we are — 6 months later — still falling, still growing.
        
        I know I’ve been a bit of a mess lately… I haven’t given you the time or presence you deserve.
        But please know — it was never because I didn’t care.
        
        I love you more than I can put into words.
        And I promise I’m trying. For us. For you.</p>

    <div class="zigzag-item right">
      <img src="memory3.jpeg" alt="Memory B" />
      <p>You’ve been my strength, my peace, and my adventure. 🥹

        This photo? It’s the best one we have together.
        Just look at us — my heart feels full every time I do.
        Mera pyaar tere liye na kabhi kam hua hai, na kabhi hoga.
        I love you way too much, baby.
        
        Main itni mehnat kabhi kisi ke liye nahi karta...
        But you? You’re different. You’re special.
        That’s why I’m putting my heart into this — because you deserve it all.
        
        Actually, you deserve so much more than this,
        but I PROMISE, I’ll give you the world someday.
        I MEAN IT.
        
        You are worth every love song ever written.
        Because **YOU ARE WAY TOOOO PERFECT FOR ME MERI JAAN!**
        And I’m the luckiest person alive to have you. 💖</p>

      <p>Six months in, and I’d still choose you — over and over. 💘

        This photo holds a very special place in my heart.
        It was — and still is — way too perfect.
        The moment we took this, everything felt right... and it still does.
        
        Tera presence mujhe sukoon deta hai.
        And honestly? Main yeh sukoon apni zindagi bhar chahta hoon.
        Kabhi bola nahi... but today I will:
        
        Tiya, I’m too afraid to lose you.
        
        So, aaj firse pooch raha hoon —
        WILL YOU BE MINE FOREVER? 💍💞
